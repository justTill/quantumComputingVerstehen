This is the official version of the class “lni” for submissions to the
“[Lecture Notes in Informatics]” published by the “Gesellschaft für Informatik”
([GI]).

It is based on previous templates created on behalf of the GI.

Quick start:
Download [lni-author-template.tex](lni-author-template.tex) and edit it in
your favorite LaTeX editor.
You will have to use [BibTeX](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/bibtex) as bibliography tool.
In case you want to use [biblatex](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) and
[Biber](https://www.ctan.org/pkg/biber), read on in the documentation of this class.
You should use `pdflatex` as `xelatex` and `lualatex` lack some features of the class file.

Stable versions are always uploaded to CTAN (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lni).
In addition you will find the most recent developer version on GitHub at https://github.com/gi-ev/lni.
The most recent documentation is available at https://github.com/gi-ev/LNI/blob/master/lni.pdf.
It includes a short description how to use the template and also provides trouble shooting hints.

Please see [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for a version history
